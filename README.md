# Craps Game
A simple fun version of the traditional dice game "craps". Something to play offline when you're bored (or have a bet to settle :) ). 
- `r` to reset
- space to play a round
- Lose screen!
- Dynamic background color indicates state of game

To play the game on Windows 64-bit, download the [windows-amd64](https://github.com/123xxgamer/craps-game/tree/main/crapsDice/windows-amd64) folder and run crapsDice.exe.

Coming soon:
- More game variants
- Customization
- High score tracking
